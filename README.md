# Spots

An image sharing site

## Description

The name of this project is se_project_spots. To describe this as I understand it from the lessons its a image sharing app where users can post and like other users images. I used VS code to write and style the code and Figma. The profect file on Figma was the source and I suppose brief as well for the project.
I used my newly learned skill display grid and grid template columns to style the cards as well as the media query for mobile screens. I am still very new and very unsure of my coding skills and I am sure I made errors. My footer and mobile screen seem sloppy to me but I did my best.
I included 2 pictures showing my first time using grid in action as well as the how the mobile layout turned out
